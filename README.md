Exploratory Data Analysis
This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis".

To run this script you need to do the following:

Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;
Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory;
Run the scripts
**P.S. I removed the names of the X axis in plot 4 and fixed the names of the Y axis to make the graphs look more consistent, so my plots slightly differ from the ones in the description**
